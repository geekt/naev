  <description>Many pilots swear by the Biometal Reinforced Hulls, and with good reason. Every planet needs pilots to bring in their goods, and the places where you can get shot up by pirates aren't always the best places to stop for repairs. With Biometal Reinforced Hulls, the pilot doesn't need to stop until he drops off his cargo.</description>
